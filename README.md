# monte_carlo_simulation_for_CoinFlip_problem

Problem Statement :
You have 17 coins and I have 16 coins, we flip all coins at the same time. 
If you have more heads then you win, if we have the same number of heads or if you have less then I win. 
What's your probability of winning?

The problem is solved using Monte-Carlo simulation
